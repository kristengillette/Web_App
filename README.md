# Web_App


Project created for <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

Many websites do more than just give you information. Sites like GitHub, Zillow, Mint and Treehouse let users do things. They act like programs you run on your computer. These web applications, often include pages for looking at your profile, what you've done in the week or what you need to get done. These "dashboards" act like your control panel for controlling the web app.

In this project, I took  a mockup and a few icons and build a beautiful, web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. I only needed to take the design and create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for this  page -- and didn't need to create other pages, or build any backend or database functionality.
